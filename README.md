# Food-101-FastAI
## Food image classification using the Fast AI library and the Food-101 dataset
The purpose of this notebook is to create a deep learning model to classify images using the Fast AI library and the Food-101 dataset. The Fast AI under the hood uses the PyTorch library. The created model will try to get close to matching some recent state of the art results and have a target of >85% for top-1 accuracy.
