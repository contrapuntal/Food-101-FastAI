# Food-101-FastAI
## Food image classification using the Fast AI library and the Food-101 dataset
The purpose of this notebook is to create a deep learning model to classify images using the Fast AI library and the Food-101 dataset. The Fast AI library uses the PyTorch library. The created model will try to get close to matching some recent state of the art results. The target is >85% for top-1 accuracy.
